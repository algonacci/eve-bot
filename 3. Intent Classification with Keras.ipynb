    "One thing I am realizing from investigating other projects is that you cannot really force a clustering model to output the intents that you would like. It's an algorithm, after all... But instead of manually labelling the intents of the Twitter dataset (that is an absolute pain, doing it by hand for every 100 thousand Tweets!), it might be worth considering an entirely different approach, one where I have a smaller dataset that I manually label. In this alternative approach, I would give each intent a few examples - which is hopefully enough for my model to recognize that intent if it sees it in the future. This is the approach taken by cortical.io, they essentially need only not really that much data for recognizing an intent. Their approach is to create a semantic fingerprint for each intent cluster. It's so that when we embed new utterances, ones with similar meaning would have a closer distance. \n",
