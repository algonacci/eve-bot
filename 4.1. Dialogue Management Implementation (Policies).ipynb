    "The Transformer Embedding Dialogue (TED) Policy is described in our paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "This policy has a pre-defined architecture, which comprises the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* concatenate user input (user intent and entities), previous system actions, slots and active forms for each time step into an input vector to pre-transformer embedding layer;\n",
    "* feed it to transformer;\n",
    "* apply a dense layer to the output of the transformer to get embeddings of a dialogue for each time step;\n",
    "* apply a dense layer to create embeddings for system actions for each time step;\n",
    "* calculate the similarity between the dialogue embedding and embedded system actions. This step is based on the StarSpace idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to use state_featurizer=LabelTokenizerSingleStateFeaturizer(...) (see Featurization of Conversations for details).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration parameters can be passed as parameters to the TEDPolicy within the configuration file. If you want to adapt your model, start by modifying the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `epochs`: This parameter sets the number of times the algorithm will see the training data (default: 1). One epoch is equals to one forward pass and one backward pass of all the training examples. Sometimes the model needs more epochs to properly learn. Sometimes more epochs don’t influence the performance. The lower the number of epochs the faster the model is trained.\n",
    "* `hidden_layers_sizes`: This parameter allows you to define the number of feed forward layers and their output dimensions for dialogues and intents (default: dialogue: [], label: []). Every entry in the list corresponds to a feed forward layer. For example, if you set dialogue: [256, 128], we will add two feed forward layers in front of the transformer. The vectors of the input tokens (coming from the dialogue) will be passed on to those layers. The first layer will have an output dimension of 256 and the second layer will have an output dimension of 128. If an empty list is used (default behavior), no feed forward layer will be added. Make sure to use only positive integer values. Usually, numbers of power of two are used. Also, it is usual practice to have decreasing values in the list: next value is smaller or equal to the value before.\n",
    "* `number_of_transformer_layers`: This parameter sets the number of transformer layers to use (default: 1). The * number of transformer layers corresponds to the transformer blocks to use for the model.\n",
    "* `transformer_size`: This parameter sets the number of units in the transformer (default: 128). The vectors coming out of the transformers will have the given transformer_size.\n",
    "* `weight_sparsity`: This parameter defines the fraction of kernel weights that are set to 0 for all feed forward layers in the model (default: 0.8). The value should be between 0 and 1. If you set weight_sparsity to 0, no kernel weights will be set to 0, the layer acts as a standard feed forward layer. You should not set weight_sparsity to 1 as this would result in all kernel weights being 0, i.e. the model is not able to learn."
