    "\n",
    "### 2. Adding the intents manually\n",
    "These ones are generated with a different method that is more manual. I will generate as much examples of this as I can, then I brute force it by duplicating it until it reaches 1000 training examples for preserving class balance.\n",

    "### 3. Adding in the hybrid intents\n",
    "I use my Keyword Exploration shown in the previous notebook and find that there is a lot of overlap between update and repair. So for both I am going to generate a proportion of it using doc2vec, and the rest I will manually insert examples - the idea is to balance overfitting or noise and putting in the correct signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "_One special case might be for out of scope, I might find an alternative way to deal with that because I cannot generate all the examples of that intent._\n",

    "Step 4 is converting the data in long format that the NN could be fed to, and the last one is to save it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was made aware of the catostrophic forgetting problem from the spaCy docs, where you aren't supposed to iterate over the same values, because doing that effectively changes the loss function, and you will make a model that cannot generalize well. This is an emperical process in the end, because I have to experiment what works best."
